            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <!-- long text:Someday, when I was playing an old game on my old computer, a question came to my mind: "How do developers make games?". Surely, the answer was programming. Programming was just what I was looking for. Invention and creation with only a desktop device and pure knowledge. So I started making games as soon as I could. However, I hadn't started my programming journey yet because my laptop didn't have the minimum requirements for installing a game engine that uses real programming languges such as Unity and Godot. The limitations forced me to use construct2, a game engine based on javascript for making 2D games. After a while I found out that I can't games. At least when I'm solo and I don't have money. After some browsing  -->
            <p>I don't want to take your time with a long text about all details of my programming journey , So let me introduce myself!</p>
            <p> I started serious programming when I was 11. I dropped it and started it again after a year. After a while I found out messing around and just saying that I know some programming doesn't help. So I started to complete little projects and get my freecodecamp certificates. I'm planning to continute education , to get a computer science certificate from a vaild university and to get more and more experienced in programming. </p>
            <p>And... That's it!</p>
